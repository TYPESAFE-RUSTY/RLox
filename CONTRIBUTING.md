## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, make sure you have a good understanding of the project and its goals. Familiarize yourself with the project's documentation, codebase, and the technologies used.

## Creating an Issue

Before you start working on a new feature or bug fix, it's important to create an issue first. This helps us track the work being done, discuss the changes, and ensure that everyone is aligned on the direction of the project.

### How to Create an Issue

1. **Search for Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, search the issue tracker to see if someone else has already reported the problem or suggested the feature you're interested in. If you find an existing issue, you can add your comments or reactions to it.

2. **Create a New Issue**: If you don't find an existing issue, you can create a new one. Provide a clear and concise description of the problem or feature request. Include as much detail as possible, such as the steps to reproduce the issue, the expected behavior, and any relevant screenshots or logs.

3. **Label Your Issue**: Once you've created your issue, add appropriate labels to it. This helps us categorize and prioritize the issues.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Once you've created an issue and discussed your proposed changes, you can start working on your contribution. Here's how to submit a pull request:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the [Your Repository Name] repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

3. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch in your local repository. The branch name should be descriptive of the issue you're addressing.

4. **Make Your Changes**: Implement the changes in your branch. Make sure to follow the project's coding conventions and write tests for your changes.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.

6. **Push Your Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to your forked repository on GitHub and create a new pull request. Make sure to reference the issue you're addressing in your pull request description.

8. **Review and Merge**: Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may provide feedback or request changes. Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
